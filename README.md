ParkWhereAh is a parking application has been developed as part of my Final Year Project module.
While it is not currently live and is not actively maintained, it offers several valuable features for anyone interested in enhancing it or using it for reference:

Key Features:

Nearby Parking Information: Discover nearby parking lots and their availability information based on your current location.
Search by Postal Code: Easily find available parking lots and carpark information by entering a postal code.
